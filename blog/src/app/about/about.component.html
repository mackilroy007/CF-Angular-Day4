    <p>There is no better place then to start at the begginning. The civil rights movement in the United States was a
        decades-long struggle by African Americans and their like-minded allies to end institutionalized racial
        discrimination, disenfranchisement and racial segregation in the United States. The movement has its origins in
        the
        Reconstruction era during the late 19th century, although the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in
        the
        mid-1960s after years of direct actions and grassroots protests. The social movement's major nonviolent
        resistance
        and civil disobedience campaigns eventually secured new protections in federal law for the human rights of all
        Americans.</p>

    <p>After the American Civil War and the subsequent abolition of slavery in the 1860s, the Reconstruction Amendments
        to
        the United States Constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African
        Americans, most of whom had recently been enslaved. For a short period of time, African American men voted and
        held
        political office, but they were increasingly deprived of civil rights, often under the so-called Jim Crow laws,
        and
        African Americans were subjected to discrimination and sustained violence by white supremacists in the South.
        Over
        the following century, various efforts were made by African Americans to secure their legal and civil rights. In
        1954, the separate but equal policy, which aided the enforcement of Jim Crow laws, was substantially weakened
        and
        eventually dismantled with the United States Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education ruling and other
        subsequent
        rulings which followed. Between 1955 and 1968, nonviolent mass protests and civil disobedience produced crisis
        situations and productive dialogues between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local
        governments, businesses, and communities often had to immediately respond to these situations, which highlighted
        the
        inequities faced by African Americans across the country. The lynching of Chicago teenager Emmett Till in
        Mississippi, and the outrage generated by seeing how he had been abused when his mother decided to have an
        open-casket funeral, galvanized the African-American community nationwide. Forms of protest and/or civil
        disobedience included boycotts, such as the successful Montgomery bus boycott (1955â€“56) in Alabama, "sit-ins"
        such
        as the Greensboro sit-ins (1960) in North Carolina and successful Nashville sit-ins in Tennessee, mass marches,
        such
        as the 1963 Children's Crusade in Birmingham and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches (1965) in Alabama, and a wide
        range of other nonviolent activities and resistance. </p>
    <p>At the culmination of a legal strategy pursued by African Americans, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1954 under the
        leadership of Earl Warren struck down many of the laws that had allowed racial segregation and discrimination to
        be
        legal in the United States as unconstitutional. The Warren Court made a series of landmark rulings
        against racist discrimination, such as Brown v. Board of Education (1954), Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.
        United
        States (1964), and Loving v. Virginia (1967) which banned segregation in public schools and public
        accommodations,
        and struck down all state laws banning interracial marriage. The rulings also played a crucial role in
        bringing an end to the segregationist Jim Crow laws prevalent in the Southern states. In the 1960s, moderates in
        the movement worked with the United States Congress to achieve the passage of several significant pieces of
        federal
        legislation that overturned discriminatory laws and practices and authorized oversight and enforcement by the
        federal government. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in Heart of Atlanta
        Motel, Inc. v. United States (1964), explicitly banned all discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex,
        or
        national origin in employment practices, ended unequal application of voter registration requirements, and
        prohibited racial segregation in schools, at the workplace, and in public accommodations. The Voting Rights Act
        of
        1965 restored and protected voting rights for minorities by authorizing federal oversight of registration and
        elections in areas with historic under-representation of minorities as voters. The Fair Housing Act of 1968
        banned
        discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.</p>

    <p>African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and young people across the country were inspired to take
        action. From 1964 through 1970, a wave of inner-city riots and protests in black communities dampened support
        from
        the white middle class, but increased support from private foundations. The emergence of the Black Power
        movement, which lasted from 1965 to 1975, challenged the established black leadership for its cooperative
        attitude
        and its constant practice of legalism and non-violence. Instead, its leaders demanded that, in addition to the
        new
        laws gained through the nonviolent movement, political and economic self-sufficiency had to be developed in the
        black community. Many popular representations of the movement are centered on the charismatic leadership and
        philosophy of Martin Luther King Jr., who won the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through
        nonviolent resistance. However, some scholars note that the movement was too diverse to be credited to any
        particular person, organization, or strategy.</p>
